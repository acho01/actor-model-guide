# Resources

## Books

**Scala In Action** https://www.manning.com/books/scala-in-action

Book gives perfect overall undestanding of scala and it's FP nature. Pay attention to mentioned links while reading.

## Youtube

**Rock the JVM** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRS4DvO9X7qaqVYUW2_dwOw

One of the best free youtube resources on scala. They also have paid courses on https://rockthejvm.com/

**Jakub Koz≈Çowski** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIE-6gx_qi0&list=PL1NS3pe5mmu3goZ5sQI-q5nFXtw1jESy0

This guy has lot's of videos on scala, but the link mentioned above is step-by-step live coding of a real project in scala using FP.

**Coding Tech** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m40YOZr1nxQ

Very informative video from tech talk with live coding a FP application from scratch using scala.

## Blogs

**Category Theory for Programmers** https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/. https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf

One of the best resources on category theory and FP. Github contains all the coding examples used in the book.

**Demystifying the Monad in Scala** https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/demystifying-the-monad-in-scala-cc716bb6f534/

This blog perfectly explains Monad idea with some comprehensive examples in scala.

**Functional Programming and Category Theory** https://nikgrozev.com/2016/03/14/functional-programming-and-category-theory-part-1-categories-and-functors/
https://nikgrozev.com/2016/04/11/functional-programming-and-category-theory-part-2-applicative-functors/

Another well structured blog about some major concepts of category theory implemented in scala

**Why Functional Programming Matters** https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf

Great paper explaining concepts of FM in depth.

**Actor Model** https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/73/Papers/027B.pdf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7erJ1DV_Tlo&t=688s

First paper about Actor model released in 1973 by Carl Hewitt. Along side with the great video of him explaining actor model in very simple manner.
Actor model enables special abstraction in concurrency that is implemented by Akka and included in scala as actor model implementation.

**Actor Model of Computation:
Scalable Robust Information Systems** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1459.pdf

More about actor by Carl Hewitt

**Physical Indeterminacy in
Digital Computation** https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3459566

More about actors particularly arbiters
