# actor-model-guide
### Repository contains all resources used by me while learning actor model using scala. As my curiosity led me to actor model and particularly Akka, list consists of some basic scala resources but mostly moves around actors.


# Resources

## Books

**Scala In Action** https://www.manning.com/books/scala-in-action

Book gives perfect overall undestanding of scala and it's FP nature. Pay attention to mentioned links while reading.

## Youtube

**Rock the JVM** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRS4DvO9X7qaqVYUW2_dwOw

One of the best free youtube resources on scala. They also have paid courses on https://rockthejvm.com/

**Jakub Koz≈Çowski** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIE-6gx_qi0&list=PL1NS3pe5mmu3goZ5sQI-q5nFXtw1jESy0

This guy has lot's of videos on scala, but the link mentioned above is step-by-step live coding of a real project in scala using FP.

**Coding Tech** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m40YOZr1nxQ

Very informative video from tech talk with live coding a FP application from scratch using scala.

## Blogs

**Category Theory for Programmers** https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/. https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf

One of the best resources on category theory and FP. Github contains all the coding examples used in the book.

**Demystifying the Monad in Scala** https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/demystifying-the-monad-in-scala-cc716bb6f534/

This blog perfectly explains Monad idea with some comprehensive examples in scala.

**Functional Programming and Category Theory** https://nikgrozev.com/2016/03/14/functional-programming-and-category-theory-part-1-categories-and-functors/
https://nikgrozev.com/2016/04/11/functional-programming-and-category-theory-part-2-applicative-functors/

Another well structured blog about some major concepts of category theory implemented in scala

**Why Functional Programming Matters** https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf

Great paper explaining concepts of FM in depth.

**Actor Model** https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/73/Papers/027B.pdf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7erJ1DV_Tlo&t=688s

First paper about Actor model released in 1973 by Carl Hewitt. Along side with the great video of him explaining actor model in very simple manner.
Actor model enables special abstraction in concurrency that is implemented by Akka and included in scala as actor model implementation.

**Actor Model of Computation:
Scalable Robust Information Systems** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1459.pdf

More about actor by Carl Hewitt

**Physical Indeterminacy in
Digital Computation** https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3459566

More about actors particularly arbiters

**Everything you wanted to know about the Actor** https://alex-karaberov.medium.com/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-the-actor-model-but-were-afraid-to-ask-b6eee8722953

Great article on medium about actor model. More conceptual and abstract discussion, without implementation details and technologies

**Intro to actor model and akka** https://blog.knoldus.com/introduction-actor-model-akka-nutshell-1/

A small article that might still be very informative.

**Concurrency in akka actor model short article** https://medium.com/@knoldus/achieving-concurrency-with-akka-actors-a115142a8721

Brief and short article about concurrency in akka using actors

**Concurrency in akka actor model long article** https://www.toptal.com/scala/concurrency-and-fault-tolerance-made-easy-an-intro-to-akka

In depth overview of concurrency and faul-tolerance of actor model implemented in Akka

**More on actor concurrency in akka** https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/java-concurrency-akka-actor-model-setting-stage-chellimuthu/

Another good resource for actor concurrency particularly in akka

**Simplifying concurrency: Actors. In particular, AKKA. - Kristo Iila**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgOfEVid4Cs

Great video explanation of actor concurrency model

**Java threads vs Akka actors** https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~kena/classes/5448/s11/presentations/srinivas_panchapakesan_pres.pdf

Nice ppt comparing traditional java threading model with actor model

**Scala Actors 101 - Threadless and Scalable** https://dzone.com/articles/scala-threadless-concurrent

More on threadless scala actors, little bit old article, no mention of akka, but still conceptually usefull

**Lightweight Actor Threads** https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.85.3148&rep=rep1&type=pdf

Paper discusses concept behind lightweight threads that actors use in JVM

**Lightweight Actor Threads 2** http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/papers/jmlc06.pdfhttp://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/papers/jmlc06.pdf
Another paper by Martin Odersky discussing threading model behind actor

**Concurrency Talk** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37wFVVVZlVU

Gold on youtube, creators of famous concurrency models having a panel discussion

**CSP concurrency model** https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/tony-hoare/csp.html

Great resource explaining CSP concurrency model, which can be considered kinda like actor model

**Akka Concurrency** https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/concurrency-akka-deep-dive-prateek-kulkarni/

Concurrency article about Akka concurrency

**Theory and Application of Multithreading
The Actor Model** https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~marten/pdf/tamt.pdf 

**More actor model** http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~phaller/doc/haller12-Integrating_actors_in_mainstream_technologies.pdf

**Gul Agha's Doctoral Dissertation on Actor Model** https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6952
This resource looks like a A-Z book about actor model.
